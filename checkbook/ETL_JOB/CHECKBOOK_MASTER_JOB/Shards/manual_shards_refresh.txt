Manual steps if refresh fails:

1. Run  sh use_group2_shards.sh (/vol2share/NYC/NYC_ETL_JOBS/CHECKBOOK_MASTER_JOB/Shards of prod etl server)
2. Restart shard1 if there are any queries running for long
3. Run nohup sh shards_refresh1.sh & (/vol2share/NYC/NYC_ETL_JOBS/CHECKBOOK_MASTER_JOB/Shards of prod etl server)  -- It will refresh shard1 and rsync the shard2 server
4. Run the below sql in master Database (mdw) and if it returns 2 rows then the above step3 is successful
   select * from etl.refresh_shards_status where shard_name IN ('shard1','shard2') and latest_flag = 1 and (sql_flag = 1 or fix_flag = 1 or rsync_flag=1);
5. Run  sh use_group1_shards.sh (/vol2share/NYC/NYC_ETL_JOBS/CHECKBOOK_MASTER_JOB/Shards of prod etl server)
6.  Run the below sql in master Database (mdw) and if it returns 2 rows then the above step5 is successful
   select * from etl.refresh_shards_status where shard_name IN ('shard1','shard3') and latest_flag = 1 and (sql_flag = 1 or fix_flag = 1 or rsync_flag=1)
7. Run  sh use_all_shards.sh (/vol2share/NYC/NYC_ETL_JOBS/CHECKBOOK_MASTER_JOB/Shards of prod etl server)
8. Update the sequence etl.seq_etl_job_id to start with the previous ETL Job id (Current -1) as below
   ALTER SEQUENCE etl.seq_etl_job_id START WITH 2 (The current value is 3 which you know by executing select nextval('etl.seq_etl_job_id') )
9. Run the below job to for solr incremental indexing. Please verify it the job is only for SOLR Incremental indexing.
	nohup sh kitchen.sh -file /vol2share/NYC/NYC_ETL_JOBS/CHECKBOOK_MASTER_JOB/NYC_Master_mtr_test.kjb -norep -level:Minimal > /usr/local/data-integration/NYCETLMaster.out &
